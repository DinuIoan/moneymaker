Develop..apps..isn't the same?
newline
    Maybe yes, but develop means much more than simply apps. Think about getting an online course from udacity by example, never is too late tpo start something new, and as you may know, being a developer means a really good life. Put your brain to work for some time and after that enjoy your rewards. It will be great I bet for it.
