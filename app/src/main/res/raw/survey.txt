Survey? Surveys are boring..
newline
    Why surveys? Because big brands are always trying to get a glimpse into consumers brains. They want to improve their products and marketing, and be sure that they are willing to pay big bucks for information that comes directly from their customers.

    On your free time, on your phone, laptop or something that can connect to the internet you can easily complete a simple survey and get paid for that. Some of them even pay up to 3-5 bucks per survey. So why wait?
