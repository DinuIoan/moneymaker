What this even mean??

    You must have an email account (otherwise you can't activate this profile right ?) and you sure have some friends on your list. Lets say that you have 2000 and you, as I said before in social media category, you have a instagram account with 1k followers. Lets say that you send to all of your 2k friends an email and promote your account. Maybe 500 of them will start following you and boom, now you have 1.5k followers. Promote your website or blog too and get visitor there as well. And as I said, a good traffic means advertising that means money.
