Social media? A big thing these days.

    Social media sites like Facebook, Instagram or Youtube can help you make a good living from them. The most important thing on these sites is that you should have at least 1k-2k friends/followers and everything should be easier.

    With some followers by example, on instagram, there are a lot of apps or webpages that help you promote products of some companies that need advertising and help you get paid for that. By example, if you have around 2k-3k you can easily make between 100-300 dollars. Easy right?

    Youtube in pair with instagram can be a powerful way to earn a little extra income. A video with 100k - 1m views gets enough money and getting there isn't that hard. Think about comic videos, vines, or something people really search on youtube and start doing it !
